# Thoughtful-AI
Steps for Implementation

1. Define the Predefined Dataset
Create a dictionary of hardcoded responses about Thoughtful AI. Each question or topic will map to a predefined answer.

2. Build the Response Retrieval Logic
Create a function to retrieve the most relevant response. If the input doesn't match a predefined question, return a generic fallback response.

4. Set Up the Chat Interface
Use Gradio to create an interactive user interface. Gradio makes it easy to deploy conversational AI with a web-based UI.

Features
Hardcoded Responses: Covers common questions about Thoughtful AI.
Fallback Mechanism: Provides a friendly response if no exact match is found.
Web-Based UI: Users can interact with the chatbot via a browser.
Examples: A few example questions are displayed to guide users.
Next Steps and Improvements
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use fuzzy matching (e.g., with libraries like fuzzywuzzy) to match user inputs more effectively.
Contextual Responses: Add conversational memory to handle multi-turn conversations.
